# Noob menu

A simple menu written in bash and using YAD for graphical interface. It was made for two reasons:
1. Not everyone knows how to use a tiling window manager, and consequently not everyone knows how to open softwar/ turn off the machine/ do other tasks. Adding an icon to the taskbar/panel of choice (i use `xfce4-panel` on my Arch setup with i3wm) where one would usually find the menu button helps eventual friends/colleagues use the machine with more ease, while at the same time giving them clues about keybindings.
2. I wanted to experiment with bash and found out about zenity/yad.

Yeah, i know, it's not high-brow humour, but what can you do,
